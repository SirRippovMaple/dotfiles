# Git post-commit hook: Automatically deletes all *.orig files in the repository.
# These files are remnants from merge conflict resolutions and can be safely removed post-commit.
# Reference: https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_post_commit

# Determine the root directory of the Git repository
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Find and delete all files matching *.orig in the repository (including subdirectories)
find "$REPO_ROOT" -name "*.orig" -type f -delete
